              At Aganitha, we have always believed that bringing together the
              power of Deep Science and Deep Tech can transform our lives, help
              us live longer and better. While most people acknowledge the
              potential of AI in the pharma industry, they are not sure if and
              when that potential will become reality.
            </p>
            <p>
              A lot changed in 2023. The widespread use of AI through ChatGPT
              changed perceptions of the use and relevance of AI in creative
              tasks. For example, we are already harnessing AI to write code to
              create end-to-end pipelines and applications more flexibly and
              easily. We are already using AI in creating user centric
              applications, with natural language interfaces.

              Beyond its ability to seemingly understand questions and generate
              responses in natural language, we at Aganitha see an opportunity
              to make AI understand and speak the language of life – DNA, RNA,
              protein sequences, molecules, genes, targets, drugs, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              This year, we at Aganitha had the opportunity to work with three
              of the top 20 life sciences companies, some of the most innovative
              and successful biotechs, and academic research labs, to translate
              the power of AI into practical and usable solutions within and
              beyond R&D.
